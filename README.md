**CAUTION** As of now, this library is more like an experiment and WIP.

CRUD client is a library which aims to make it easy and lightweight to access REST APIs for CRUD operations.

As of now it just tries to make it easy to work on list of entites. E.g. assuming a school-database containing a table for pupils, it allows listing all pupils, select and edit it on the client, sending the update back to the server or deleting it.

It is mainly thought to be used iin ViewModels like vue.
